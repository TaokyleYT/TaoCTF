# TaoCTF

A CTF originally created by [Tao](https://github.com/TaokyleYT) for his bro [Ken](https://github.com/kingmusicer1) for his birthday (why not)

**All materials related and/or showed one's irl identity have been permitted to be used here and published publically (through here)**

The original copy is stored in a hard drive, designed for a serverless CTF. **Therefore to submit the flag, please run `VerifyFlag.py`**\
And yes since this is being run locally, there is no web exploitations and no PWNs, as they usually requires you to access a flag file on the servers, and there is no servers here, just your own machine.

This shit is created within 3 days, please be aware of the low quality CTFs

For any (unlikely) updates in the future, please do a git pull from https://github.com/TaokyleYT/TaoCTF

Please be aware that some challenges includes a file called `BIG_HINT.txt`. It contains a big hint (mostly related to late-extraction, usually spoils the first parts at some extent) so only open it if you feel very stuck for very long time\
Some big hints may make the challenge way easier and less fun, you have been warned.

Also please read the README.md before trying the challenges, it may contain some useful information (as well as a hint)

**Have fun!**

(*all chals are verified to be solvable, if you can't solve it, skill issue.*)
