# reverse engineering/TaoKen

It seems that an anonymous company invented a new type of token called TaoKen.

There's also an exe file extracted from the company's application, which is the admin login terminal.

I wonder what the taoken that logs you in is...

Flag format: TaoCTF{admin_token}

Hint:\
There MIGHT be multiple correct answers, but the correct flag uses the one with no spelling mistakes.
