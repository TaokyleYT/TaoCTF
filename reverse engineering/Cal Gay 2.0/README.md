# reverse engineering/Cal Gay 2.0

Are you disappointed by how your calculator only got 680 bytes of programming memory and lack of complex operations without programs?

Introducing Cal Gay 2.0, with 0 bytes of programming memory and even less operations available!! Thats -500% improvements!

Wait.. where does the smell come from.

Flag format: TaoCTF{[a-zA-Z0-9_]}

Hint:\
You might be able to do binary exploitations, or do some decryption on the flag (if you managed to find where it is).

However, the easiest way to solve it is to try different inputs to the calculator and see what it does.

Oh also unlike TaoKen, there is no skips in case you get frustrated and want the source. No source code for you sorry
